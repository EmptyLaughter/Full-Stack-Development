### React Notes

## Why React
*Declarative: can describe overall result rather than describing individual steps to achieve result
*Component based: separates components to allow for reusablity  

## Document Object Model
* DOM: interface for managing elements in HTML page
* Virtual DOM: pure JavaScript representation of a DOM tree
    * Fast and cheap
* React makes minimal changes when rerendering
* Three main parts:
    * Name (div, span, script)
    * Attributes: key-value pairs that add more information
    * Children (optional)
        ```React.createElement('Name', {
        href: "https://github.com/emptylaughter"
        , "EmptyLaughter"})
        ```
